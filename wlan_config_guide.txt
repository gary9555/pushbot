########## This is a guide for configuring the WLAN module (ACKme AMW00x series) used for the pushbot ###########
# Author: Gary Wen
# Remarks: We had quite a hard time trying to configure the module to work (and it's currently still half-working), so to 
  make up for the lack of documentation on this, I've written up a brief configuration guide for this specific WLAN module, 
  hopefully it saves time for someone who uses it in the future. 
# Thanks to Enea, Greg and Federico for helping in configuring the module, and thanks to Andreas and Julian for providing
  a lot of instructions during the process
 
Configuration procedure for the module:
1.	!!!!!Configuration via serial port only works on windows!!!!!! 

2. Download putty: http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/download.html

3. Connecting the wlan module to PC
   a) Connect the wlan module to the PC via a serial module, then open Putty 
   b) In the "Session settings" (top left), change the Connection type to "Serial" and then write the correct 
   COM port into the Serial line textbox, and set the Speed to 12000000(12M)(if doesn't work, try 115200). 
   c) Switch to the Serial settings (bottom left) and verify that they match what you just entered. Further, 
      change Flow control to "RTS   /CTS" (i.e. enable hardware handshaking) and ensure Data bits is 8, Stop 
      bits is 1 and Parity is None (often referred to as 8N1). 
   d) Switch to the "Terminal settings" (third from the top left), and tick "Implicit CR in every LF", as well
      as set to Force off both Local echo and Local line editing.
   e) After pressing the Open button, the putty console shall pop up. 
   
4. Configuring the wlan module on putty
   a) To enable configuration of the wlan module, quickly type "$$$" in the putty console, then a ">" character
      will show up indicating that the device is in command mode
   b) Type "set wlan.ssid YOUR_NETWORK_NAME" to set the network name
   c) Type "set wlan.passkey YOUR_NETWORK_PASSKEY" to set the password of your network
   e) Type "set wlan.auto_join.enabled true" to enable auto joining the network
   f) ##### This step is very important ###### Type "set uart.baud 1 4000000 raw" to set the baudrate to 4M, so the 
      next time you connect the module via serial, remember to set the baudrate to 4M instead of 12M
   g) Type "set bus.mode stream" to enable the module to stream data from the pushbot
   h) Type "get wlam.mac", and the mac address of the module will show up, please note it down because it might 
      be used in the later steps when we want to find it's allocated IP address
   i) Type "save" to save the settings
   j) Type "reboot" to reboot the module
   
5. We can also configure the wlan module via tcp (the Telnet function on putty) after we get the mac address of
   the module in the previous section
   a) Connect the module to serial port again just like in section 3(remember to set the baudrate to 4M instead of
      12M because we have reset it in the previous section), it shall automatically connect to the previously set 
      network.
   b) Quickly type "$$$" in the putty console to enter command mode
   c) Type "get wlan.network.ip" to get the IPv4 address of the module allocated by the network
   d) Close the serial port, but keep the module powered on
   e) Now that we know the IP address, we can connect to the module via telnet
   f) Open putty again and choose the Connection Type as "Telnet"
   g) Enter the IP address of the module we just got, and the port number 56001, then press "Open", and the PC
      should be able to communicate to the module via tcp now
   h) ##### Alternatively, we can also fetch the IP address by using netscaning tools(e.g. "arp-scan" on linux 
      and MAC OS) and look for the respective mac address of the wlan module
   
6.	Communicating with the pushbot via wifi
   a) Now we can mount the wlan module directly on the pushbot
   b) The pushbot's serial port doesn't open automatically(which is the problem whose solution I haven't 
      figured out yet), so we have to manually open it's serial port and keep it open
   c) Use telnet on putty to connect to the same address as we acquired during the last section, and PLEASE!!!
      NOTE!!!THAT!!! the port number should be set to 56000(56001 is for configuring the wlan module, 56000 is
      for communicating with the pushbot)
      
After all these tedious steps, we can finally communicate and control the pushbot through wifi!
