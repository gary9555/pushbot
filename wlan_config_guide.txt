This is a brief guide for configuring the WLAN module (ACKme AMW004) used for the pushbot

We had quite a hard time trying to make the module work (and it currently still half-working), so here’s a brief configuration guide for this specific WLAN module, hopefully it saves time for someone who uses it in the future.
 
Configuration procedure for the module:
1.	!!!!!Configuration via serial port is only available in windows!!!!!!
2. Download putty: http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/download.html
2.	The Baudrate of the module is 12M (please also notice that the pushbot's Baudrate is 4M)
3.	Set up Wlan username, password
4.	Reset baudrate to 4MHz (consistent with pushbot baudrate)
5.	To configure via tcp (the Telnet function on putty), port number 56001
6.	To communicate with pushbot, port number 56000
